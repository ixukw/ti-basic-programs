# ti-basic-programs

This is a repo of most programs I have on my TI. It is to serve as a backup for myself in the future. 

To view the programs, either load them onto your TI, an emulator, or online using Cemetech.

I think the most notable are KITTENS.8xp and MINES.8xp and their dependencies. Other, better programs can be downloaded from ticalc.org.
